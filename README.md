fuel-debug-plugin
============

Plugin enables additional debug output for MOS services.
This plugin could be useful when we try to get know
what's wrong with some service, try to get requests/responces
for example.
After plugin installation there should be more info at the 
logs of the services mentioned at environment_config.yaml.
